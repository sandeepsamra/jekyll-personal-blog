                <p>Bookworm is a Lighthouse Labs midterm project completed over the span of three days by Natalie Famula and I.</p>

                <p>Bookworm is an app for managing the books you're reading, and the books you want to read. You can add a book and a cover photo to your list of books you want to read, and once you're done reading you can move it to another list and leave comments that you can look at later. It's ideal for those of you who read so much that you would like to leave comments for yourself, and for those who like to jot down quotes, etc.</p>

                <p>We were introduced to Sinatra the same week that we started this project. If we had more time, we would have liked to implement user interaction, as well as a "Start a Book Club" section so that a user can start a book club discussion about a book, and other users can decide if they want to join. We also recognize that we need a comment model, so that each book can have multiple comments (from the user, as well as from other users)</p>

                <p>Before you say anything -- yes -- it's super ugly. BUT, because of the time crunch I decided to focus on functionality instead of presentation. Rotten Mangoes was a Lighthouse Labs assignment designed to introduce us to Ruby on Rails.</p>

                <p>It is a web application that allows a user to add movies to a database, and to access particular movies using a search form. Building this app helped me learn how to create an admin, and make it so that an admin user can add, update and delete other users, and send them an email when their account is deleted.</p>
